				Earlier this summer, as rabbits darted up and down the park near my sublet and red cardinals, unafraid of the humans they soared above, pecked at nuts and berries people tossed at them during their lunch breaks, I started thinking about Animorphs again. In 7th grade, I devoured the series with an intensity only reserved for the most seminal books of my childhood. I watched the short-lived TV adaptation under the covers in my grandmother's spare room and kept my class's copy of <i>The Invasion</i> (Book #1) at home for an entire year because I really liked the lenticular cover. But it was always an isolated affair — maybe because I hoarded that only copy to myself, most likely because our teachers were encouraging us to graduate to The Hunger Games and The Fault in Our Stars, and I eventually shelved Animorphs with other books that I loved but felt like I was rapidly outgrowing.

				You can never really outgrow books, is what I've learned since then. Animorphs, with its deceptively bizzare covers and digestible paperback form, contained a laundry list of complex themes that covered war, violence, body dysmorphia, genocide, torture, cannibalism, imperialism, body horror, child soldiers, morality, suicide, bloodlust...and etcetera for an audience of 8-12 year olds. Reading it once as a pre-teen doesn't do it justice. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that there's been somewhat of a pandemic-spurred Animorphs renaissance lately (Google '<i>rereading animorphs</i>' and all the headlines are bound to be like <i>wtf were we reading back then</i>), and it wasn't hard to fall back into this crazy world of alien wars and children with secret powers.

				While the series sold over 35 million copies, it never really entered the cultural mainstream along with some of its more famous contemporaries, like Harry Potter and Goosebumps. In 2011, Scholastic <a class="a" href="http://mediaroom.scholastic.com/node/405">relaunched</a> the series with lenticular covers to replace the uncanny yet charming art on the original books (created by artist David B. Mattingly) and updated cultural references here and there in hopes of drawing in 'a whole new generation of readers'. The project fizzled out after 7-8 books and was cancelled due to low sales. No new prints have circulated since then. Fortunately, there are online versions floating around on the internet (and K.A. Applegate herself has allegedly okayed this), but I stubbornly wanted to get ahold of the physical copies and figured that it shouldn't be too hard to find them at a local library.
				<br><br>
				Like many of the series' 8-12 year old readers, I didn't have a car, so I wanted to illustrate the distance and time one would have to spend to collect all the books.

			  <p>This summer, I lived by the Tufts University campus in Somerville, MA.</p>

			<div class="step" id="step-1">
				<p>There's no shortage of libraries here. The Tisch Library at Tufts is only a 5 minute walk away in one direction. The <strong>Somerville Public Library West Branch</strong> is an 8 minute walk in the other.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="step" id="step-2">
			  <p>I didn't have strong expectations for the former, but I was surprised to learn that the children's section of the public library didn't have any of the Animorphs books.</p>

			<div class="step" id="step-3">
				<p>I visited the <strong>Charlotte and William Bloomberg Medford Public Library</strong> next. After a 30 minute walk in the summer heat, I was excited to find some of the books available and sat down to read one. They didn't have the first book, however, so I randomly picked Book #52 to read.</p>

			<div class="step" id="step-4">
			  <p>To get to the <strong>Malden Public Library</strong>, I had to take a 20 minute bus and walk another 15 minutes. Luckily, they had the first book!</p>

			<div class="step" id="step-5">
			  <p>The route to the <strong>Cambridge Public Library - Central Square Branch</strong> involved a bus and two subways. It's a gorgeous aquarium of a library, and I sat on a bean bag next to the glass walls to catch the afternoon sun.</p>

			<div class="step" id="step-6">
				<p>The <strong>Honan-Allston Branch of the Boston Public Library</strong> is built like a Canadian ski lodge. A children's librarian saw me reading and we excitedly discussed our favorite arcs in the series (mine is the David trilogy, his was the Ellimist chronicles).</p>
