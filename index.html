				Earlier this summer, as rabbits darted up and down the park near my sublet and red cardinals, unafraid of the humans they soared above, pecked at nuts and berries people tossed at them during their lunch breaks, I started thinking about Animorphs again. In 7th grade, I devoured the series with an intensity only reserved for the most seminal books of my childhood. I watched the short-lived TV adaptation under the covers in my grandmother's spare room, and kept my class's copy of <i>The Invasion</i> (Book #1) at home for an entire year because I really liked the lenticular cover. But it was always an isolated affair â€” maybe because I hoarded that only copy to myself, most likely because we were being encouraged to graduate to The Hunger Games and The Fault in Our Stars, and I eventually shelved Animorphs with other books that I loved but felt like I was outgrowing.

				You can never really outgrow books, is what I've learned since then. Animorphs, with its deceptively bizzare covers that feature each phase of a character morphing into an animal (or an alien, sometimes), was 

				written by K.A. Applegate, her husband Michael Grant, and a team of ghostwriters. 
				The books sold over 35 million copies altogether but fizzled out 
			</p>
			<p class="main-body">
				In 2011, Scholastic <a class="a" href="http://mediaroom.scholastic.com/node/405">relaunched</a> the series with lenticular covers to replace the uncanny yet charming art on the original books (all created by artist David B. Mattingly) and updated cultural references here and there in hopes of drawing in 'a whole new generation of readers'. The project fizzled out after 7-8 books and was cancelled due to low sales. No new prints have circulated since then. Fortunately, it's not hard to find online versions floating around in the internet (and Applegate herself allegedly approves of this)
